Modules
-Three types
    pages - modules that handle routing; only loaded once in appmodule or lazily
    global services - modules with services needed throughout the entire app
    reusable components - modules with reusable components (material, etc)

Feature Modules
    -must declare all of the components, directives and pipes it needs
    -must import commonmodule instead of browsermodule
    -it doesn't bootstrap anything
    -each module should have a routing module
    -every lazy loaded module has its own injector

appmodule > coremodule

-coremodule should perform a check to prevent loading it twice

    export class CoreModule {
        constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() core: CoreModule) {
            if(core) {
                throw new Error('CoreModule has already been loaded.')
            }
        }
    }
